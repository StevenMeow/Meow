              only to discover that the Tower is a strange and dangerous place
              where people go to fulfill their greatest desires. To find Rachel
              again, Bam must face deadly tests and formidable opponents, all

            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>The scene opens in a dim cave, where Baam chases Rachel and pins her to the floor. Baam asks Rachel where she is going and Rachel responds that she is sorry but she is going to climb the Tower and Baam should just forget her. A door opens up and Rachel is swallowed through, but Baam follows, ending up in the 1st Floor. He looks around and is greeted by Headon. After getting over the initial shock, Baam asks whether Headon had seen Rachel. Headon avoids the question, only responding by saying that the answer, like everything else, could be found on the top of the Tower. Headon then initiates the Ball Test and Baam takes it without hesitation.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Yuri and Evan are running down the stairs in the middle area. Yuri somehow knows of Baam’s entrance into the Tower and they arrive in time to observe Baam’s conversation with Headon. When they see that Baam actually takes the test, they jump down, much to Evan’s distress, and stop him. Yuri gives him a pocket, after which he understands Yuri and Evan. Yuri is certain of foul play on Headon’s part, but unable to prove it, asks him why he initiated a test meant for 20th Floor Regulars. Headon retorts that if she thinks it’s so unfair, Yuri could give Baam Black March. To Evan’s shock she agrees and after determining his resolve, gives it to him. When Evan asks her why she lent it to him, she answered that she merely liked him.</p>
            <p>Facing the Steel Eel, Baam thinks of what Rachel means to him and recognizes that he fears something more than death. Evan knows that the only way to pass the test is to get eaten, then stab at its tongue. Only while it was stunned could Baam make his way to the ball and pop it. To Evan’s amazement, Baam does it and makes his way to the ball. Unfortunately, due to Headon’s tampering the ball does not pop and the Steel Eel regains consciousness. Yuri tries to help but cannot. Evan yells out for Baam to ignite Black March and to everyone’s surprise, he succeeds. To Yuri’s indignation, Black March only helped Baam because it had a crush on him. As Black March ignites, the ball still doesn’t break. Instead, it teleports him up to the next Floor. Yuri is furious with Headon, but can’t do anything so she and Evan leave.</p>
            <p>In the middle area, Evan broods about Baam and wonders if such determination exists, as he himself has forgotten his reasons for entering the Tower.</p>

            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>Baam has a flashback to when Rachel was teaching him in the cave, specifically about fighting. Baam comes around in a grassy field and listens to Lero-Ro announce the rules of the death-match. It takes him a while to comprehend what is required when Lero-Ro tells them to “reduce the number of Regulars from 400 to 200”. As soon as he understands what is required, he is forcefully introduced to the violence and brutality that exists in the Tower when he is attacked by a swordsman, who is in turn killed by an archer, who is then killed by a sniper. He runs away and encounters a member of the Da-an Tribe. Driven by the violence he is about to attack when he is stopped by Khun Aguero Agnis. Elsewhere, Hatsu and Anak have met and they immediately start fighting. Ship Leesoo comes by and is completely ignored.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Rak Wraithraiser tosses the sniper off the cliff and looks around for strong opponents only to find that everyone qualified. His attention is immediately caught by Anak, realizing that it is her weapon that is giving off the formidable presence. He realizes that it would be dangerous to fight her and his attention is instead drawn to a similar presence: Black March. Khun and Baam have run behind a large boulder and Khun is amused at Baam’s inability to lie.</p>
            <p>Suddenly, he notices Rak and makes various jokes about him. When it is established that he wants to fight Baam, they run away again. Khun is rendered speechless when he realizes that the weapon Baam holds is actually Black March. He decides to stick around, deeming Baam to be interesting. Suddenly, the first round is over and they receive new instructions from Lero-Ro and have to make two “buddies”. This poses a problem for Khun and Baam. Nevertheless, Khun tries to negotiate with Rak to no avail. Mercilessly, Khun makes the decision to kill Rak quickly, but Baam intervenes and drops the Black March. Rak is confounded and responds to this problem by attacking Baam. They run towards Rak and grab onto him as the time is up, qualifying them for the next round. Hatsu and Anak were fighting, but when they received new instructions they immediately made peace to the amazement of Leesoo. Unfortunately, they leave for a stronger teammate leaving Leesoo in the dust. It is unknown how Leesoo got the others to accept him.</p>

            <h3>Lero-Ro's Test</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Ch.09: 2F - Lero-Ro's Test (1) | (p. 231-254)</li>
              <li>Ch.10: 2F - Lero-Ro's Test (2) | (p. 255-272)</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>Baam, Khun and Rak enter Evankhell’s carrier, Leesoo is in awe at all the people that have passed, though his teammates are unimpressed with him and their surroundings. Khun warns Baam to look at every Regular as their greatest enemy, which Baam finds difficult to do.</p>
            <p>A fight breaks out between two Regulars over the events that happened in the first round, but the fight is instantly quelled by the arrival of Lero-Ro and his reputation as a Ranker. Khun explains how remarkable a Ranker’s capabilities are, just as Lero-Ro initiates a new test. He blows everyone (except for Baam, to his disbelief) back with a shinsu barrier, talking briefly about the important factor that luck plays in life.</p>
            <p>Due to Baam correctly guessing Anak would pass through the shinsu barrier first, Lero-Ro agrees to answer Baam’s questions. After stating that he hadn’t seen Rachel, he outlined the structure of the Tower and gave the definition of Irregulars. Baam asked if he could meet them and Lero-Ro responded that he could at the top of the Tower.</p>
            <p>They were interrupted by a Regular cursing the barrier and Lero-Ro. Lero-Ro responded by generating shinsu and increasing the density to that commonly found on the 30th Floor. He leaves the Regular collapsed on the ground and returns to Baam.</p>

            <h3>Yu Han Sung's Examination</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Ch.11: 2F - Yu Han Sung's Examination (1) | (p. 273-287)</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>As Lero-Ro contemplates the cruelty of ‘God’ and leaves the aggressive Regular curled up on the ground, he returns to Baam as Leesoo and Serena Rinnen force their way through the barrier.</p>
            <p>Their next examination is conducted team by team. While Baam’s team is waiting, his hopes that the blue ceiling is a sky is dashed by Khun. They are interrupted by the screams of another team. They are the fifth team to go and, before they go in, they are given a clue by Neonbag: that they have to finish the test within 5 minutes. As they enter the room, they are greeted by Yu Han Sung.</p>
            <p>Khun has a flashback to when he was in the Khun Family, illustrating Khun's upbringing and his intense distrust towards anything. Back in the present, Yu Han Sung explains the rules for success and gives them no more clues, to the aggravation of Baam’s team. He uses the full force of his intellect and tries to think his way out of this test, but as he is thinking, Rak just opens a door. To Khun's outrage, the goal of the test was to open any door. Because of his mistrust, he needed allies that could trust and take leaps of faith without any concrete proof.</p>
            <p>The other teams all passed due to strange reasons. Leesoo was the only one who correctly used the clue given to him by Neonbag and deduced what was supposed to be done. One team relied on blind and false faith and Laure picked one randomly due to his laziness.</p>
