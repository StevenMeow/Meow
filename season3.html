            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>Quant tells Yu Han Sung that only three people passed the deathmatch test because he didn’t check and there was one of Zahard's Princesses and an Irregular in the mix. Aware of Evankhell’s strict reputation, Yu Han Sung quickly comes up with a plan to salvage Quant’s mess.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Baam is having a small conversation with Leesoo when Lero-Ro comes and announces that an optional bonus game is available, with the prize being immediate advance to the next floor. In the arena, he explains the rules for the Crown Game.</p>
            <p>Hatsu's team and Shopin's team participate in round one of the game. Shopin's team is easily beaten by Anak alone after which she steals the crown. Hatsu's team, First Emperor's team and Laure's team participate in round two. Anak takes the crown while Hatsu fights First Emperor's team and Leesoo fights with Serena Rinnen and Ho. Hatsu easily defeats First Emperor's team and moves on to help Leesoo.</p>
            <p>The defeat of First Emperor's team triggers Laure's plan. He wakes up from where he appeared to be sleeping and starts blasting shinsu at Anak while his teammates move in on her trying to take the crown. His shinsu attack fails to harm Anak. She becomes angry, ignites her weapon, and uses it to attack Laure.</p>
            <p>Laure dodges her attacks but she suddenly stops when she senses Baam's weapon, the Black March, resonating with hers. Laure notices her change in behaviour, but before he can make anything from it, his team forces him to forfeit the game. Anak jumps off the throne, causing her team to lose, and breaks into Baam's room demanding that he gives her the Black March.</p>
            <p>A long discussion ensues ending in Baam's refusal to give up the weapon. She is about to attack him when Lero-Ro interferes. He tells her that she is disqualified (because she jumped off the throne), that she should get back in her room and that he won’t forgive any further misbehaviour. She starts to leave, but then instead asks Lero-Ro if he could change the rules as she wants to make a wager. If Baam wins, he gets both the Green April and the Black March, but if he loses she gets both the weapons. Lero-Ro says it sounds like fun. She explains the bet to Baam and asks him if he accepts it. Baam refuses again. She then threatens to come after him when the game is over. Baam is reluctant to get his friends involved, but Khun ends up accepting the bet in Baam's place.</p>
            <p>Lero-Ro agrees to add a new rule. The rule state that Baam and his teammates will participate in all the remaining rounds starting with the third round. If he succeeds in those rounds, he gets the Green April. If he fails, he loses the Black March. The new rule doesn't alter any existing rules.</p>
            <p>On the way pack to their room Hatsu's team passes Rachel's Team. Androssi says something to Anak which provokes Anak. Anak is about to attack, but Hatsu stops her. She continues, walking off in disdain.</p>
            <p>Khun's team has a long conversation with each other which includes one of Baam's flash back. In the flashback Rachel tells him that he must not betray people especially girls and if he does, the world's ceiling will fall in.</p>
            <p>Rozéal's team, Levin's team, Khun's team and Aleksai's team participate in round three of the game. At the start of the game Rozéal, Levin and Chungchung strategize that this round is all about speed. All three of these people feel they have the advantage when it comes to speed, but are quickly proven wrong by Khun. Moving incredibly fast, Khun takes the crown.</p>
            <p>With the crown in his hand, Khun taunts the other teams by telling them he could win the round immediately but it wouldn’t be fun and challenges them to take the crown instead.</p>
            <p>They all move to attack him, but before they can get to him he throws the crown into their midst for them to fight over. While everyone else is attacking Chungchung moves in to try and steal the crown while no-one is looking.</p>
            <p>The various Regulars go and attack Khun's team, but using Khun's Manbarondenna and Rak's skill with his spear, Rak and Khun are able to fend off the Regulars while protecting Baam at the same time.</p>
            <p>The remaining enemies (Levin, Rozéal, and Leon 3) try and rush them by attacking at the same time. All of their attacks are stopped mysteriously (maybe because of something done by Baam or by the Black March). Afterward, Khun and Rak quickly take out the remaining attackers.</p>
            <p>Chungchung meanwhile has been trying to sneak to the throne with the crown. Khun is aware of this fact and mocks Chungchung by reveals to her that the crown she has is a fake replica made by Manbarondenna. Chungchung feels outraged that her entire effort has been futile.</p>
            <p>Khun's team, Blarouse's team, Hoshi's team and Red Hair's team participate in round four of the game. Red Hair's team and Hoshi's team decided to gang up on Khun's team, but both teams are quickly defeated in a surprise attack by Khun's other team. It is revealed that Blarouse's team made a deal with Khun during the first test on the Second Floor. The deal was that Khun would help the other team through their tests by carrying them in his bag in exchange for them helping him pass his tests. He signaled that he wanted their help by removing his bandanna in the third round. After defeating Khun's enemies, Khun's other team forfeited the game making way for Khun's team to pass.</p>
            <p>Khun's team, Rachel's team, Hwa Ryun's team, Dhadi's team and Azadni's team participated in round five of the game. At the start of the round Hwa Ryun annihilates Dahdi's team and Azadni's team. She then turns her sights on Khun's team. Rak and Khun move in intercept her but she jumps over them landing on the throne next to Baam. Khun and Rak try to go help Baam but they are intercepted by Hwa Ryun's teammates Yung Changsoo and Goon. She moves to strike him but is blocked by Androssi. Baam starts to defend himself but one of Androssi's teammates reassures Baam that this wasn't their goal and Baam realized it is Rachel underneath the hood.</p>
            <p>Hwa Ryun and Androssi fight with each other while Yung Changsoo and Goon fight with Rak and Khun. Rak and Khun win their fights and Khun feels that they pretty much have the Game in the bag since Rachel's team isn't playing to win, but Androssi trips because of her impractical shoes and Hwa Ryun gets by her. Hwa Ryun moves to attack Rachel. Baam protects her with his body, sustaining a head injury whilst using shinsu to attack Hwa Ryun's eye. Baam is badly injured and his team is disqualified because he lost contact with the throne. The only team left in the game is Rachel's team and they choose not to steal the crown. Thus the Crown Game ends with no winners.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Yuri and her friends are making their way down to Evankhell's Hell and Kurudan unwittingly claims that if there was anyone who could move freely in a Steel Eel breeding ground, he would give his wing tree to him. They leave with Evan thinking that Baam was really dangerous.</p>

            <h3>Rest</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Ch.26: 2F - Rest (1) | (p. 107-130)</li>
              <li>Ch.27: 2F - Rest (2) | (p. 131-156)</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>After the Crown Game, Rachel’s team didn’t take the crown and Hwa Ryun was carried away. Lero-Ro confronts Yu Han Sung, saying that his test was a failure since Rachel’s team didn’t ascend. Yu Han Sung responds by telling Lero-Ro the true purpose of this Floor, asking him who the most dangerous person was and if they weren’t stopped because of a certain person he sent. As Lero-Ro leaves, he asks Yu Han Sung if there was anyone he knew of that could manipulate shinsu without a contract. Yu Han Sung says that he’s only heard of Urek Mazino performing such a feat. As Lero-Ro walks away, Yu Han Sung comments to himself that Lero-Ro was difficult to control.</p>
            <p>Elsewhere, Anak walks into Leesoo's room and tells him to talk to Black March, since Black March wouldn’t talk to girls. Leesoo tries multiple times, only to get severely electrocuted. She leaves in disgust, walking into Androssi along the way. Anak is called a fake by Androssi and tries to punch her but fails. She asks Androssi about Rachel, who responds that she got the impression that she shouldn’t fight her because she came from an unnatural place.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Khun is sitting by Baam's bedside when Rachel comes in. They talk about Baam’s past with her, and the legend of the Tower and what’s outside. Rak is also worried about Baam, though he comically denies it.</p>
            <p>Two days after the Position Test starts, Baam regains consciousness.</p>

            <h3>Position Test</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Ch.28: 2F - Position Test (1) | (p. 157-192)</li>
              <li>Ch.29: 2F - Position Test (2) | (p. 193-220)</li>
              <li>Ch.30: 2F - Position Test (3) | (p. 221-252)</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>Unconscious, Baam has a flashback to when Rachel told him about the top of the Tower, the Zahard crest engraved above them. He wakes up, and Khun tells him that the Position Tests started two days ago, but the Wave Controller instructor couldn’t turn up so the tests for Wave Controllers were postponed.</p>
            <p>Baam asks Khun about Rachel and Khun lies to Baam, as he promised Rachel, and says that the girl wasn’t actually Rachel. Baam doesn’t believe Khun, but leaves it, and heads to the Wave Controller classroom.</p>
            <p>They are greeted by Yuga, who goes on to describe shinsu. The class then make a contract with the Guardian. The Guardian makes the contract with Baam, parting with the warning that “this was not his power but his shackle”.</p>
            <p>In the Spear Bearer training area, Yu Bok-Dol challenges them to hit a target far away, and if they succeed within four days they automatically pass. Rak steps up and fails completely and the target is broken by Akryung.</p>
            <p>After some days, Baam had just finished another of his shinsu classes when Laure demonstrates the difference in talent between Ho and Baam and the importance it plays. Baam goes back to his room with Khun when they are approached by Leesoo and Hatsu, who are trying to make friends. The negotiations quickly deteriorate as they insult each other. Their stories get out of hand, as Hatsu affirms that he would commit Halbok if he ordered the wrong instant noodle for his father and Khun tells stories about people on his Floor wearing at least 5-6 earrings. Baam interrupts them, agreeing to become friends, despite Khun's protests that they were just trying to fill a quota. Recalling Rachel's words on how lonely Baam was, Khun agrees and also signs the sheet.</p>
            <p>In the night, Rachel has a dream of being among the starry night and sees Baam in the distance. She beckons towards him but he turns away to his friends. She wakes up crying.</p>

            <h3>Zahard's Princess</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Ch.31: 2F - Zahard's Princess (1) | (p. 253-)</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>Androssi orders food from the counter and listens to Hatsu’s failure to get friends on his list. Baam (jokingly?) attempts to set the two up, but Androssi reveals that Zahard's Princesses aren’t allowed to marry or have children.</p>
            <p>In the Fisherman training area, the Fishermen face off on multiple tall cylindrical blocks and have to knock each other off. Androssi doesn’t expect anyone to attack, since most of them can’t jump such a distance, but Anak jumps over to Androssi and they fight. Androssi easily avoids Anak, even making her push all the other Regulars off their pillars.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Khun practices with his Lighthouse when he realizes something strange about Anak: only a Ranker could have Green April. He does some searches and realizes that Anak Zahard is dead.</p>
            <p>Back in the testing arena, Anak gives up trying to defeat Androssi with her needle and strengthens her body with shinsu, gaining enough speed to catch up with Androssi. But Androssi evades her and throws her down onto the pillar. She then goes on to say that she knows that Anak is really Anak Zahard’s daughter: her “one and only niece in the Tower”.</p>
            <p>Androssi asks Anak why her mother chose poverty and inevitable death over the prestige of a princess and Anak has a flashback. She and her parents lived in a small house in a grassy field and her mother had come back from an argument with her father. She asks why her mother married and received the response that it was the chicken pie her father made. Back in the present, Anak reveals her intentions to Androssi: to kill everyone possessing the Zahard name and dashes towards Androssi, trying to sweep her legs out from under her. Androssi jumps up, but her high heels can’t take the pressure and they break, giving Anak the opening she needed to push Androssi off. Unfortunately, Androssi grabs onto Anak and takes both of them down.</p>
            <p>Lying at the bottom of the testing arena, Androssi asks if Anak’s mother ever regretted marrying. Anak has another flashback to when her mother died and she gave her the gemstone she found earlier. She was then taken away by someone with a semblance to Evan Edrok.</p>
            <p>A day later, Baam is practising shinsu manipulation when Khun informs him that Androssi and Anak might be disqualified. Baam wants to help, but Khun tells him that in order to climb up, he'll have to fail people as well. This dilemma saddens Baam, but he perks up when Khun says there's a way to help Androssi. Using food Baam manipulates Androssi into becoming a friend, though the food ultimately falls and splatters both of them.</p>
